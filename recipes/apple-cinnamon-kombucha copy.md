# Ingedients {.recipe-ingredients}

* Apples, 6
* Cinnamon, a few sticks
* Kombucha, 1 week old
* 1/3 cup of Lemon Juice
* 1 cup of Water
* 1/3 cup of sugar

# Directions {.recipe-directions}

1. Chop apples into small cubes
2. Add some 1 cup of water, sugar and cinnamon to a pot along with chopped apples and bring to a boil
3. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes
4. Leave to cool and then add to 4 liters of freshly made kombucha about a week old
5. Let it sit overnight before bottling, it will require some sort of filtering, I use a sieve inside a funnel so helps bottling and removes big particles.
6. Give it a few days for a bit of fizz and then refrigerate
