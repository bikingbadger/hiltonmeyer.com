# Ingedients {.recipe-ingredients}

* Kiwi, 6 peepled and sliced
* Jalepeno pepper, 3 sliced
* Cucmbers, 6 peeled and sliced
* Kombucha, 1 week old
* Mint, bunch
* 1/3 cup of sugar

# Directions {.recipe-directions}

1. Blend peeled cucumbers, mint leaves and kiwi's to juice
2. Add jalepeno peppers and juice to fermentation vessel
3. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes
4. Leave to cool and then add to 4 liters of freshly made kombucha about a week old
5. Let it sit overnight before bottling, it will require some sort of filtering, I use a sieve inside a funnel so helps bottling and removes big particles.
6. Give it a few days for a bit of fizz and then refrigerate
