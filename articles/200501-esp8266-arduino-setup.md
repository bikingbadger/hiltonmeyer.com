This is more just a placeholder for future me to have a reference of how to setup a connection to the Wemos Arduino Board that I have. It's the Wemos D1 R1. I have managed to connect to the board using the following settings although I have yet to fully understand the actual pins on the board which I will come back to later to map out.
