[Yesterday](/articles/191001-adding-update-date-11ty) was looking for a way to add the updated date to my static site, generated by 11ty, at the bottom of each article. I wanted to show the creation date and the last updated. I started will the following in my layout but the date being returned was then out put as "Last updated Thu Sep 19 2019 03:00:00 GMT+0300 (Israel Daylight Time)":

*article.njk* 
```
---
layout: layouts/base.njk
templateClass: tmpl-article
---
<p class="title">{% raw %}{{ title }}</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{{ content | safe }}{% endraw %}

Last updated {% raw %}{{ updated }}{% endraw %}
```

So I now needed a way to format the date instead of getting back such an unwieldy string and having something a bit more human readable. To the docs I went and found that there was something on using [dates](https://www.11ty.io/docs/dates/). I saw they were using a Javascript method for correcting the dates ```.toUTCString()```. this got me wondering what other things I could use and if it was simply the Date object. So I added [```.toString()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toString) and it worked. Well it worked in so much as I got back a full string with the date as above which is what [```.toString()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toString) does according to the documentation on MDN. I noticed there was [```.toDateString()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toDateString). BINGO!!!  

*article.njk* 
```
---
layout: layouts/base.njk
templateClass: tmpl-article

<p class="title">{% raw %}{{ title }}{% endraw %}</p>

{% raw %}{{ content | safe }}{% endraw %}

<footer>Create on {% raw %}{{ page.date.toDateString() }}{% endraw %} - Last updated {% raw %}{{ updated.toDateString() }}</footer>{% endraw %}
```

You may have noticed that I added the ```page``` to the date for creation date as this is working and how the 11ty documentation describes to use [Page Variable Content](https://www.11ty.io/docs/data/#page-variable-contents)
