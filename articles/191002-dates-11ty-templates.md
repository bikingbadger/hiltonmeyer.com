navtitle: Dates in 11ty used in templates

I was looking for a way to add the updated date to my static site, generated by 11ty, at the bottom of each article. I wanted to show the creation date and the last updated. I started will the following in my layout but the date being returned obviously was then out put as "Last updated Thu Sep 19 2019 03:00:00 GMT+0300 (Israel Daylight Time)":

*article.njk* 
```

layout: layouts/base.njk
templateClass: tmpl-article

<p class="title">{% raw %}{{ title }}{% endraw %}</p>

{% raw %}{{ content | safe }}{% endraw %}

Last updated {% raw %}{{ updated }}{% endraw %}
```
