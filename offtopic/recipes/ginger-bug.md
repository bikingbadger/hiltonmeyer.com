# Ingredients {.recipe-ingredients}

* 3 cups water
* 3 teaspoons organic sugar
* 3 teaspoons diced ginger
* Additional sugar and ginger for maintenance

# Directions {.recipe-directions}

1. Combine all ingredients in a quart jar.
2. Place a tight lid on the jar, give it a shake, and ferment in a warm spot (72-80°F) for 24 hours.
3. Every day for the next week add 2 teaspoons each of sugar and diced ginger. The liquid will begin to bubble towards the end of the week. If you’re using the classic cap-and-band jar lid, you will be able to feel the top of the lid for pressure. Once there are bubbles forming at the top of the mixture, it’s ready to use for soda making.
4. To keep the bug alive and continue growing it, feed it daily using the proportions above. Or rest it in the refrigerator and feed it 1 tablespoon each of ginger and sugar once per week. To reactivate the ginger bug for making soda, bring bug to room temperature and begin feeding it again daily (step 3, above).
