# Ingredients {.recipe-ingredients}

* grated rind of 2 lemons
* 100g grated ginger
* 250 ml (1 cup) freshly squeezed lemon juice (see Note 2, below)
* 6 raisins
* 250g white sugar
* 4.5 litres water
* Ginger bug starter or a teaspoon of yeast

# Directions {.recipe-directions}

1. Using the fine teeth of a cheese grater, grate the lemon rind directly into a large stainless pot, I use my pressure cooker as it holds around 8 liters so plenty of space. Then grate in the fresh ginger, using the coarse teeth of the grater adding it to the pot along with the sugar
2. Pour 1.5 litre of the water into the pot and bring heat over the stove stirring until the sugar has completely dissolved. Turn off the heat and leave to cool for a few minutes. Now pour another 3 litres of cold water into the solution along with the freshly squeezed lemon juice and raisins.
3. Once the temperature is around body heat you can add the ginger bug to the water.
4. Cover the pot with cling film and put it in a warmish place. Leave mixture overnight and let the ginger bug go to work. During this time, you'll see the raisins begin to spin in the water and the mixture will burble softly. Wait until most of the vigorous bubbling has stopped. My ginger bug is really aggressive and I have had exploding bottles so best to leave it to finish the primary fermentation.
5. Strain the ginger beer to remove the grated ginger and the lemon rind. through a sieve and a funnel into plastic bottles. I place the pot in the counter and on the floor put some paper towels down under the bottles. 
6. Using a tube I pre-fill with water I create a siphon. With the drop the ginger beer fills the bottles easily. Once done tighten the lids to allow for carbonation in th esecondary fermentation.
7. Leave on the counter at room temperature and check the pressure build up in the bottle by pressing on the plastic bottle. When it's firm you can put them in the fridge.
8. Enjoy once chilled, best to leave overnight. Be careful when opening
