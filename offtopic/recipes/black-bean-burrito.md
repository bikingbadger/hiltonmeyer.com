* 1 pound dry black beans
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 Tbsp ground cumin

# Directions {.recipe-directions}

## Preparing dry beans
1. Place black beans in a large bowl or pot. Cover with 2 inches of water, let soak overnight, then drain. You can skip overnight soaking, place black beans in bowl, and cover with 2-inches of boiling water. Let soak for one hour. Then drain.
2. Place soaked and drained beans in a large pot. Cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer.
3. While the beans are coming to a boil in step 2, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small pan on medium heat. Stir in the ground cumin and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the minced garlic, cook a minute more. Once the beans are boiling, add the cumin and garlic to the pot with the beans. Add bay leaves and salt to the pot as well.
4. Cook the beans, uncovered, until tender, but not mushy, 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the size and age of the beans.
5. When the beans are done, place a strainer over a separate pot. Pour the beans into the strainer, to collect the cooking water into the pot. Set aside the beans, and boil down the cooking liquid until thickened and slightly syrupy. Return the cooking liquid to the beans and stir.

## Preparing the rest
1. Place 3 cups of rice in a large saucepan. Depending on the type of rice you are using (short grain, long grain, white, brown) you will add any where from 4 1/2 cup of water to 6 cups of water to the pot. 
2. Check the rice package instructions. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 
3. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to low to maintain a very low simmer. 
4. Cover and cook from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, depending on the type of rice (again, check the package instructions for the rice you are using). 
5. Remove from heat and let rest for 10 minutes, covered, before fluffing with a fork to serve.
6. To construct the burrito bowl, place a serving of cooked rice at the bottom of a serving bowl. Top with black beans. 
7. Top with assorted garnishesâ€”thinly sliced cabbage, chopped avocados, chopped cilantro
