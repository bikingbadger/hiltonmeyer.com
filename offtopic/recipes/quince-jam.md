# Ingredients {.recipe-ingredients}

- 5 quince rinsed, grated without core\*
- 4 1/4 cups water
- 4 cups sugar
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1 tbl lemon zest

# Directions {.recipe-directions}

1. Prepare the quince by washing and cutting in half. Working around the core, grate the quince flesh (including the peel) with a cheese grater, until you have about 6 cups of grated quince.
2. Put 4 1/4 cups of water in a large (6-8 quart), wide, thick-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the grated quince, lemon juice and lemon zest. Reduce heat and simmer until the quince is soft, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the sugar and bring to a boil again. Stir to dissolve all of the sugar. Lower the heat to medium high.
4. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally until quince jam turns pink and thickens to desired consistency, about 30-50 minutes.
5. Ladle into hot, sterilized canning jars\* and seal. Before applying the lids, sterilize the lids by placing them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Wipe the rims of the jars clean before applying the lids.
