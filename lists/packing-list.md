**Lesson from Holland**
* Choose destination by cheapest flight first, Kayak is a great place to start
* Much cheaper options on AirBNB one something like HomeAway
* Start packing a week or two beforehand
* Buy the stuff for the trip a month before the flight
* Buy clothes at least a month before to get used to before to it
* Make sure flights are in the evening
* Check that credit card has a big enough limit
* Take something in the luggage for the first meal that is quick and easy to prepare
* Make sure phones are open with either a sim free card or that the phone has a bundle
* Make a list of gifts for people and either spend a day buying presents or tick them off as you go
**Lessons from Spain**
* Check for Museums before hand in the City
* Check for historical buildings/parks
* Check for festivals if there are any in the city.
* Pack as light as possible. Don't need so many clothes and make sure they are light weight and also quick to dry
